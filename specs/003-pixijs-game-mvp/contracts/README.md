# API Contracts: PixiJS Game MVP

**Feature**: PixiJS Game MVP | **Date**: 2026-02-01

## Overview

This MVP establishes the basic PixiJS rendering environment with an empty game canvas. No external APIs or data contracts are involved at this stage.

## Contracts

None - client-side rendering only with PixiJS.

## Future Considerations

When game features are added (e.g., game state management, asset loading, user interactions), contracts will be defined here for any external services or data structures.
