- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Validation Notes (2026-01-25)

- Reviewed `spec.md` and confirmed the presence of P1 (build), P2 (deploy), P3 (responsiveness), and P4 (docs link) acceptance criteria.
- No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers found in the spec text.
- Measurable success criteria (SC-001..SC-004) are present and technology-agnostic.

## Notes

- Spec is ready to proceed to planning (`/speckit.plan`).
